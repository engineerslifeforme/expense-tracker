# Expense Tracker

A streamlit app that tracks expenses in a SQLite database.

I inherited the database format from a previous project so the project
does not currently have a way to setup a fresh database.  I may
attempt to fix that.

# Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Browser should open.
